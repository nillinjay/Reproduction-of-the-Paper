# Speckle reduced lensless holographic projection from phase-only computergenerated hologram

## 摘要

```
基础方法：
利用虚拟汇集光替代随机相位进行空间相位传递

主要成就：
1.在数值模拟和实际中验证了对散板噪声的抑制作用
2.可以很好的利用slm的空间尺寸，最紧凑型无透镜全息投影有很好的作用


```

## introduction

> More recently, T. Shimobaba introduced a “random phase-free (RPF)” method \[12, 13] that can improve the image quality and reduce the speckle noise by multiplying the image with an initial spherical phase. Despite usefulness in terms of speckle problems in lensless holographic projection applications, the RPF method suffers limitation of image size due to existence of zero 随即县er and conjugated component

这表明原来的只用球面初始相位来代替随机相位是不太ok的


```

> First, 4-f optical filtering system is employed to reconstruct complex amplitude, increasing the complexity of the system by the presence of bulky lenses, which requires much space due to its finite focal length and aperture. Second, the size of the reconstructed image is greatly restricted, because when the image size is larger than the CGH, the desired information of the complex amplitude image is difficult to be filtered by 4-f system.

这表明利用4-f系统会大大增加系统的复杂度

**所以我们得出结论**
    我们得到了一种可以解决散斑噪声的方法，并且可以缩放达到slm的最大衍射带宽
